# Data Structures and Algorithms (LAB+Theory) Guide for 3rd Sem CPS
## üìã Course Overview
This course combines Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++ with traditional Data Structures and Algorithms, and includes Python implementations. This unique structure helps build a strong foundation in both programming paradigms and DSA concepts.  
## üìö How to Use This Guide
1. Follow the sections in order - concepts build upon each other
2. Complete the practice problems for each section
3. Implement the code examples in both C++ and Python where applicable
4. Review the PYQs at the end of each major section
